# Introduction -- Urban soils
- Affect most of the worldÂ´s population *[@ref?]*
- Past degradation by industry means soil organic matter is far from saturation *[@stewart07]*, also suggests fast recovery potential *[@kumar16]* while far from saturation 
- Land can serve to improve autonomy of oppressed communities, especially in post-industrial cities *[@beniston16]*, including in tropics (global South)
  
# Introduction -- Tillage
- Causes long-term degradation with tractor *[@reviewSoilTillage]*
- But, may help jump-start agriculture on vacant land
- Roto-tiller is more publicly accessible and may work as well as tractor
  
# Introduction -- Cover crops
- Long understood *[@carver::white]*, but poorly adopted given extra cost *[@seedPatents; @sugarSaltFat]*
- Improve multi-functionality beyond income to longer-term soil fertility *[@blesh17]* and ultimately food sovereignty
- Can be mixed and tailored to specific functions based on needs in region *[@perfecto/Rodale?]*
  
# Introduction -- This study
- Research Question -- How can tillage and cover crops affect urban soil functions?
- Hypothesis -- 
- Predictions -- 
  - Tillage --
    - lowers depth of hardpan soil (root-inaccessible)
    - increases --
      - water infiltration
      - yield of [rooting/tuber] crops
  - Cover crop mixes --
    - tailored toward alleviating compaction will --
      - lower hardpan depth
    - tailored toward suppressing weeds will --
      - lower weed cover, density, and richness/diversity
    - of perennials will --
      - lower hardpan depth
      - lower weed cover, density, and richness/diversity

# Methods -- Study site
- Function -- 
  - MSU Detroit Partnership for Food Learning and Innovation (DPFLI), extension outreach, education, and demonstration center
  - Former elementary school since *2016*
- Habitat -- Upland of river ~0.5 mi / 0.8 km away (`r RgoogleMaps::getGeoCode("16745 lamphere st")`)
- Soils -- 
  - Technosol classification, given large metal artifacts can be found from fillings during highway road construction
  - Topsoil A horizon 1-2", subsoil B horizon "muted" yellow color
  - Heavy metal elements below EPA human hazard levels *(Table \@ref(tab:chem))* *[@EPA]*
```{r chem}
source(here::here("tables/chem.R")); chemKbl
# knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figs/plots.png"))
```

# Methods -- Experimental design
  - Tillage -- No-, Roto-, Tractor-
  - Cover crop mixes *(Table \@ref(tab:crops))*
    - Null -- No manipulation
    - Perennial -- vetch, clover, wheat
    - Compaction -- radish, clover, ryegrass
    - Weed Suppression -- cowpea, buckwheat, sorghum-sudangrass
```{r crops}
source(here::here("tables/crops.R")); cropKbl
```

# Methods -- Data collection
  - Compaction -- Penetrometer reading of depth measuring 2 MPa
  - Infiltration -- ## fl oz
  - Weed suppression -- cover, density, diversity/richness
  - Yield -- root length, mass of tillage radish "bunch"/cluster
  - One growing season May - October 2019

# Methods -- Statistical analysis
- Data --
  - transferred from field, to Excel/Sheets, to `r version$version.string`
  - centered at plot level, with median
- R packages -- *rstatix* `r packageVersion("rstatix")`, *ggpubr* `r packageVersion("ggpubr")`, & *tidyverse* `r packageVersion("tidyverse")`
- Conservative non-parametric rank tests -- Kruskal-Wallis, post-hoc Wilcoxon with *ggpubr::stat_compare_means()* for all comparisons shown
  - sampling times pooled by variable, due to negligible effects, except infiltration
  
# Results -- Compaction
- Affected overall significantly under each cover crop mix *(Fig \@ref(fig:comp))*
  - Perennial mix showed most consistent responses
- vs. No-till --
  - Tractor *hardpan depth was higher* in Perennial and Weed Suppression mixes (significantly), as well as Null and Compaction (marginally significantly)
  - Roto-till *was lower* in Perennial mix (significantly)
- vs. Roto-till --
  - Tractor *had deeper hardpan* in Perennial mix (significantly)
```{r comp, fig.cap="Compaction data"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figs/compactionPlot.png"))
```

# Results -- Infiltration
- Affected overall by tillage (significantly) but not cover crop mixes *(Fig \@ref(fig:infil))*
- Roto-till showed faster infiltration vs. both No- and Tractor-till (marginally significantly) in each sampling period *(Fig \@ref(fig:infil)a)*
- Weed Suppression mix independently showed higher infiltration vs. Null mix (significantly) *(Fig \@ref(fig:infil)b)*
```{r infil, fig.cap="Infiltration data"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figs/infilPlot.png"))
```

# Results -- Weed suppression
- Affected overall more by cover crop mixes (significantly) rather than tillage *(Fig \@ref(fig:weeds))*
- Tractor-till increased weed Density overall (significantly), and independently vs. both No- and Roto-till (significantly) *(Fig \@ref(fig:weeds)a)*
- Weed Suppression mix reduced weed Density and Richness (but less so Cover) vs. Null, Perennial, and Compaction mixes (significantly)
  - Weed Suppression did reduce weed Cover vs. Null mix (significantly)
- Both Perennial and Compaction mixes also lowered weed Density vs. Null mix (marginally significantly)
```{r weeds, fig.cap="Weed data"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figs/weedPlot.png"))
```

# Results -- Yield
- Not affected overall by tillage *(Fig \@ref(fig:yield))*
- No-till yielded more massive radishes vs. Tractor-till (significantly)
```{r yield, fig.cap="Yield data"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figs/yieldPlot.png"))
```

# Discussion -- Hypothesis
- tillage strongest, and cover crop can follow as second
- hypothesis?
- roto-till may be most balanced approach, justifying popularity
  - relatively moderately improved compaction and infiltration
  - tractor-till sacrificed topsoil infiltration for alleviating deeper subsoil compaction
- cover crop mixes can have strongest effects on weed suppression, even while also tailored to other functions

# Discussion -- Processes
- till...
- weed suppression mix effects may come from sorghum-sudangrass, since cowpea usually promotes growth via N-fixation

# Discussion -- Other studies
  -
  
# Discussion -- Conclusion
- tillage strongest, and cover crop can follow as second
- roto-till may be most balanced approach, justifying popularity

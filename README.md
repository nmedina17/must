Managing urban soils project 
by Michigan State University Extension's Detroit Partnership for Food, Learning, and Innovation

This field study analyzed how tillage and cover crop mixes affected agriculturally relevant urban soil functions, including compaction depth, soil water infiltration rates, weed pressure, and yield.

Highlights --
- Roto-till improves urban soil compaction and infiltration vs. no-till
- Tractor-till improves compaction but not infiltration and also increases weeds
- Cover crop mixes suppress weeds
- Forage radish yield not affected by till or cover crop mixes
- Roto-till and cover crop mixes help improve soils for urban agriculture

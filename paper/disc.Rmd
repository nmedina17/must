Overall this study informs urban soil management by supporting the use of tillage to address compaction issues and improve infiltration, together with cover crops to also reduce weed pressure.
We observed partial support for our hypothesis, in that tilling weakened compaction...

Our data indicated that tilling significantly reduced compaction over a single growing season in both roto-tilled and tractor tilled plots *(Fig. 1)*.
However, several no-till plots reached similar depths to rototilled plots, which suggests rototilling is not significantly more effective than no-till at reducing compaction. 
Forage radish plant weight with foliage responded better in no-till plots that rototill and tractor tilled plots and average weights in the tilled groups were similar. 
This was supported by detecting significantly higher radish yields in no-till compared to rototill and tractor till plots, while simultaneously measuring faster infiltration in rototill plots. 
We also observed significant suppression of weed species diversity and overall density in the cover crop mix plots named for that targeted function, showing that the weed suppression mix used in this study can directly be applied in soils like these.


## Tillage


Two reasons for tilling soil are reducing compaction and killing weeds. 
In this experiment, both tractor and rototilling reduced compaction, loosening soil at lower depths than the no-till method *(Fig. 2)*. 
Tractor tilling with a subsoiler, moldboard plow, and rototiller likely created a high soil disturbance from the soil surface to depths as low as 30.48 cm or 12 inches. 
The data show that greater levels of soil disturbance increased the density of the two most common weeds, velvet leaf (*Abutilon theophrasti*) and pigweed (*Palmer amaranth*), and decreased the diversity of other weed species *(Fig. 4)*.

\

The results show that the intensity of tillage corresponds negatively to compaction depth. 
This effect also lasts throughout the growing season, even though the average depth of compaction tended to decrease over the growing season *(Fig. 2)*. 
Specifically, tractor tilled soils appeared to have a greater loss in compaction depth compared to no-till soils. 
This is probably a combination of the natural tendency for clay soils to increase in compaction over time and weather conditions, limiting plant root penetration of soil to depths that would maintain soil looseness *(Boswell et al. 2020)*. 
Our data align with our previous predictions and other studies *(Özpinar & Çay, 2005)*.
Depending on what crops are grown, addressing compaction may not be an immediate issue. 
Multiple crops have shallow root systems or are harvested before roots grow over 10.16 cm or 4 inches into the soil. 
If crops do not require deep root systems, a no-till method may suffice *(Krause & Black, 1995)*, eliminating the time, energy, and costs of tilling. 
An important observation for urban soil management was that rototilling and tractor tilling in particular exposed and removed debris from soil that would have remained in place with a no-till system. 
The debris consisted of construction materials like rebar, wires, cables, bricks, cinder blocks, and pipes as well as other refuse. 

\

Finally, the reduction in compaction in the rototilled plots *(Fig. 2)* may indicate that plant roots from both cover crops and weeds can reduce compaction. 
Over multiple seasons, if crops with deep root systems are used, tilling may loosen soils at lower depths and facilitate deeper roots to establish more quickly than no-till. 
Roots that penetrate to lower depths in soil allow plants to increase their access to nutrients and the water *(Arshad, 1990)*.


## Infiltration


Soil’s ability to absorb water is critical for stormwater management, minimizing erosion, and making water available to plant roots. 
Rototilled plots had the fastest infiltration early in the growing season *(Fig. 3)*. 
This coincides with predictions compared to no-till plots, but is the opposite of what we expected when compared to more deeply disturbed tractor tilled plots. 
This may be explained by how compost was incorporated into the plots.

\

For the no-till plots, compost was simply mulched on the surface, and after passing through this layer, water accumulated on the more compacted layer beneath. 
In rototilled plots, compost was incorporated into the top six inches creating a more porous soil with organic matter throughout. 
Compost in the tractor tilled plots was mixed in deeper than the other two treatments and may have become too sparse. 
Thus, these more clayey soils were not porous enough to infiltrate water at high rates. 
The infiltration rate decreased regardless of tillage treatment between the sampling dates, which was consistent with the pattern of increased compaction throughout the season. 
The rate was so slow in the no-till and tractor till plots that these soils were draining  less than one hundredth of a gallon in one minute. 
This suggests that most water from a one inch rain event would result in runoff. 
We posit that maintaining porosity and deeper compaction depths will allow soils to infiltrate water at rates that can absorb 2.54 cm or 1 inch rain events. 
Based on our findings, rototilling and incorporating additional compost, may be an effective method to improve water infiltration during the driest time of year. 
Rototilling disturbed the soil enough to reduce compaction, but not to the extent where organic matter was lost or highly dispersed.


## Weed suppression


Overall weed density tended to be highest in tractor-tilled plots *(Fig. 4)*. 
This was likely due to increased soil disturbance exposing seeds in the soil seed bank and creating open space for weeds to emerge. 
Higher weed density is an additional downside to the tillage of similar soils by tractor, along with lower infiltration rates. 
Regardless of tillage treatment, the weed suppression mix of sorghum-sudangrass, buckwheat, and cowpea significantly reduced both weed density and species richness by more than a factor of two in some plots compared to the other cover crop mixes. 
This result is supported by recommendations from other studies that pair buckwheat and sorghum-sudangrass *(Smith et. al, 2015)*. 
Weed richness may have decreased due to competitive exclusion by sorghum-sudangrass via allelopathy, and by buckwheat via better phosphorus mining and use *(Jabran 2017; Zhu et al. 2002)*.

\

The weed suppression mix can be utilized to frame crop beds, keeping out encroaching weeds, or to reduce weed pressure in an area that will be planted in the fall or following season. 
The buckwheat and sorghum-sudan grass grows quickly in poor soils and even dry conditions. 
These plants accumulate a lot of biomass, which allows them to shade out weeds. 
They also can be mowed to prevent re-seeding and winter-kill, making them easier crops to manage than crops that require more maintenance. 
This experiment was designed to require no management after seeding (i.e. no irrigation, weeding, or mowing). 
Under these conditions, most of the cover crops did not perform well, and were probably inhibited by the warm and dry summer conditions. 
Crops in other mix treatments used here usually prefer to be sown in the cooler early season *(United States Department of Agriculture, 2015)*. 
This experiment highlighted crops could be used in clayey soils under these conditions: forage radish, buckwheat, cowpea, and sorghum-sudangrass. 
Aside from reducing weeds for crop production, weed suppression can reduce pollen counts and the likelihood of direct contact with people *(Katz et al. 2014; Katz & Carey 2014)*. 
In urban areas this has implications for serving communities where asthma and respiratory illness is common, as well as preventing exposure to weeds that may cause irritation. 
Under managed landscapes could have cover crops sowed to alleviate some of these urban issues. 


## Yield and root length


Forage Radish tended to grow the most in no-till plots, which was unexpected based on the higher compaction in these plots. 
We posit that the radishes benefited from having more access to the nutrients in the compost that was simply mulched on the top two inches of the no-till plots. 
The compost in the other tillage treatments was incorporated throughout the soil of other plots and less available. 
It was also surprising that yield did not correspond with faster infiltration, since no-till plots had slower infiltration compared to rototilled plots. 
This suggests a more nuanced relationship between infiltration and root crop yield unlike the relationship between infiltration and compaction. 
Yield responds more to more stable or longer-term reservoirs of water and nutrients, such as those in mulched compost, than to shorter-term or more transient influxes brought by infiltration processes *(Schlegel & Havlin 2017)*. 
Furthermore, more stable reservoirs of water and nutrients may also foster more productive associations with soil microbes, which serve as an additional source of available nutrients for plant roots. 
In these cases, soil microbe availability might depend less on pH. 
These data suggest that similar alternative soil management practices like no-till combined with compost and mulching application gives better yields. 
Thus, forage radish can be an effective cover crop in reducing compaction and building soil structure, with minimal or no mechanical tillage *(Chen, 2010)*. 
Our study also warrants future studies on the processes tying yield to land management in similar soils.

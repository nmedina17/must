<!-- **Mixing cover crops suppresses weeds and roto-till improves urban soil compaction and infiltration** -->


**Highlights:**

- Roto-till lowers urban soil strength and improves infiltration vs. no-till

- Tractor-till lowers soil strength but not infiltration and also increases weeds

- Cover crop mixes suppress weeds

- Forage radish yield not affected by till or cover crop mixes

- Roto-till and cover crop mixes help improve soils for urban agriculture

<!-- **Mixing cover crops suppresses weeds and roto-till improves urban soil compaction and infiltration** -->


**Highlights:**

- Tractor-till improves compaction but not infiltration and also increases weeds

- Cover crop mixes suppress weeds

- Forage radish yield not affected by till or cover crop mixes

- Roto-till and cover crop mixes help improve soils for urban agriculture

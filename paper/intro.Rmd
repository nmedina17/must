Urban soils could improve the livelihoods of most of the world *[@acuto18]* by helping adapt to climate change, slowing erosion and storm-water runoff management, and promoting local forestry *[@pavao-zuckerman08]*, however, many urban soils are degraded for agriculture, after decades of industrial use, including sealing and structural engineering *[@lal15]*.
Urban soil issues are notable in post-industrial cities of the mid-western USA, where thousands of vacant lots still show high compaction, pH, and chemical contamination *[@beniston16]*.
These degraded urban soils also have low organic matter, but also being far from carbon saturation *[@stewart07]* can increase potential responses to intervention *[@kumar16; @kuzyakov19]*, potentially explaining comparable soil organic matter levels between very large cities and even un-managed habitats *[@cambou18]*.
Single strategies like adding compost are popular, and indeed are beneficial for various physical, chemical, and biological properties *[@cogger05]*, but they also can become cost-prohibitive and have limiting side effects like nutrient imbalances including excess phosphorus *[@small19]*, calcium, and/or magnesium, which overall in turn highlights the benefits of simultaneous strategies, like cover cropping and occasional tillage, that could better target multi-functionality *[@sircely12; @blesh17; @garbach17; @tresch18; @oriordan21]*.
Urban agriculture has spread as a response to diverse community needs *[@london21]*, from systemic food insecurity to schooling access and labor imbalances, and also widely engages non-profits, politicians, and individuals in environmental stewardship addressing public health issues like pollution *[@block12; @clendenning16; @garcia-sempere19; @siebert20]*. 
Community-led infrastructure governing vacant land additionally means that urban growers invest much of their personal and borrowed money, time, as well as other limited resources into lot preparation for initial cultivation *[@daftary-steel15]*, 
but often need to move ahead with varying models of holistic approaches *[@grossman03]* to jump-starting cultivation in urban soils that have industrial legacy effects *[@wade21]*, jeopardizing regionally high yields *[@mcdougall19]*, and often without written records of successful and/or sub-optimal farm growing practice trials *(pers. comms.)*.

Mechanized tilling is one strategy that can offer short-term benefits, but also at the cost of both long-term finances and soil health, especially as mechanical intensity increases.
In the short term, tilling can improve soil porosity to lower soil bulk density *[@hill85; @badalikova10]*, improve nutrient availability *[@wolkowski90]*, and control weeds *[@barberi01; @cordeau20]*, thereby also likely improving water infiltration and drainage that can facilitate faster seeding and early crop establishment *[@monti01]*.
However, in the long term (i.e. over five years), soil aggregates can weaken *[@six02a; @catania18]* lead to faster soil erosion *[@richter21]*, eventually increasing grower dependency on intense tillage to maintain previous yields *[@decarcer19]*, all of which resemble causes of the USA Dust Bowl and even the fall of ancient civilizations *[@lal07; @montgomery07; @amundson15]*.
To combat degradation, no-till and minimal-till have been supported as sustainable alternatives to industrial agri-business farming *[@wang06; @roger-estrade10]*, although, continuing research is still needed to address different challenges like more weed pressure *[@anderson07]*.
Since urban growers already have limited access to machinery *[@daniel07]*, yet given the short-term benefits of tillage for quick initial productivity, community sharing systems have been set up for tractors and rotary implements, which can lead to mixed or variable management strategies being adopted for urban soil cultivation, which are in need to further study *[@bazzoffi98; @materechera09]*.

Cover cropping is another regenerative agriculture practice with old origins, but whose lasting benefits are increasingly recognized *[@perez21; @richter21]*, however, more studies could go beyond single species to complementary species mixtures.
Cover crops are named so because they cover fallow soils, also continuing root activity and limiting erosion *[@garcia-gonzalez18]*, but benefits can vary by species used.
For example, legumes like cowpea (or black-eyed peas, *`r taxize::comm2sci("black-eyed pea")[[1]]`*), clovers (*Trifolium sp.*), and hairy vetch (*`r taxize::comm2sci("hairy vetch")[[1]]`*) have symbiotic root bacteria that fix nitrogen from the air into soil pores where it becomes bioavailable to plants *[@grossman05]*.
Somewhat similarly, buckwheat (*Fagopyrum esculentum*) helps scavenge soil phosphorus *[@possinger13]*, often a limiting macro-nutrient in clay soils *[@mori22]*, which could also be combined with phosphorus-rich compost to alleviate recurring soil phosphorus deficiencies.
Other plants, including grasses like sorghum (*`r taxize::comm2sci("sorghum")[[1]]`*) can grow deep roots with chemical defenses, called allelopathy, that harm other weed roots *[@weston89]*.
Overall, cover cropping may also increase soil organic matter through complex processes *[@king20]*, though few studies show direct correlations between soil organic matter and yield *[@oldfield19]*.
Organic yet industrial farms can benefit from specific cover crops, but their mechanization also limits their use to monoculture, where as small urban agriculture can make use of labor that replaces machinery to study new cover crop mixture designs that could accelerate early cultivation efforts.
Cover crop mixtures generally remain understudied empirically in agriculture *[@mead81; @bedoussac15; @baraibar20; @bourke21]*, but it could be hypothesized that combining sorghum, cowpea, and buckwheat together would improve soil nitrogen, phosphorus, and weed control, via their root symbioses and chemical defenses.
In general, integrated approaches to small-scale urban agriculture could be useful internationally *[@stewart13]*, but tailored research that informs grower decision-making remains diffuse.

In this study, we investigated how different tillage techniques and cover crop species mixes, representing varyious possible integrated management strategies, affect urban soil functions for agriculture.
Tillage methods studied ranged from low intensity using a broadfork to high intensity using a tractor and implements. 
Additionally, cover crop species mixes were chosen based on target functions including reducing compaction, suppressing weeds, and perenniality (i.e. potential for sustainable re-growth). 
We hypothesized that both tillage and cover crop mixes would confer similar benefits to soil functions, which would also translate to affect weed pressure and yield.
Accordingly, we predicted that roto-till, a moderate-intensity option, would best balance compaction and weed pressure benefits, deepening where soil hardpan layers occur that limit root penetration, and thereby also increase soil water infiltration rates, along with reducing weed cover, density, and diversity. 
We also expected that the cover crop mix designed against soil compaction would have the deepest depth to soil harpan, along with the fastest water infiltration rates compared to other mixes, mostly due to the deep rooting potential of forage radish (*`r taxize::comm2sci("radish")[[1]]` var. longipinnatus*) and ryegrass (*Secale cereale*).
Finally, we expected that the cover crop mix designed for weed suppression would experience the lowest local weed cover, density, and diversity, due to allelopathic chemical defense traits from buckwheat (*Fagoprum esculentum*) and surghum-sudangrass (*`r taxize::comm2sci("sorghum")[[1]]` x `r taxize::comm2sci("sorghum")[[1]]` var. sudanese*).
